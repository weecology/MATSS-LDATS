\title{Run Latent Dirichlet Allocation on Tabular Data}
\usage{
run_LDA(data, max_topics = 6, nseeds = 200,
  control = LDATS::LDA_controls_list())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame or tibble; each row is an observation (e.g. in
time or space), and each column is a variable. Here, the common usage is
for each column to be a species or taxon, and each row to be an observed
sample. In the original specification for LDA, each row is a document,
and each column is a word, with the entries being the counts of the words
in each document.}

\item{max_topics}{the maximum number of topics to try (the function will
test a number of topics from 2 to \code{max_topics})}

\item{nseeds}{Number of seeds (replicate starts) to use for each 
value of \code{topics}. Must be conformable to \code{integer} value.}

\item{control}{Class \code{LDA_controls} list of control parameters to be
used in \code{LDA} (note that \code{seed} will be overwritten).}
}
\value{
the best fit model object, from running \code{LDATS::parLDA()}
}
\description{
Test the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model on the data
with different number of topics (from 2 to \code{max_topics}), select the best
one using AIC, and return the model object that is selected.
